Project #2- Voiced/Unvoiced phonemes detection

Description:

This project aims to discriminate between voiced and unvoiced phonemes using short-time
speech parameters, such as short-time ZCR and short-time amplitude. The values of the thresholds of
these parameters, used to discriminate voiced and unvoiced parts can be chosen by experience, or through
training a neural network based on the speech parameters and their statistics (mean and variance). In
particular, this training can be achieved on different speakers of different gender (male and female) in
order to make the neural network learn different instances of speech parameters. The final code can be
presented with a graphical user interface.


Keywords:
